Draft a comprehensive Technical Requirements Document (TRD) for three new features: 1) A 'Product Analytics' service to track views, 2) A 'User Wishlist' feature, and 3) A 'Referral System' where users can invite friends. For each feature, detail the database schema changes, API endpoints, and required frontend components.


We need to implement a way for users to log in and sign up. Please draft a development plan for the Authentication system.
